    <p>Welcome to my playlist website! My name is Elizabeth and I have a huge interest in and love for music. I 
        love how every song tells a story and can put someone in any mood. My favorite types of music are indie
        pop along with house music. I have a huge range of artists I listen to some honorable mentions are 
        Dayglow, COIN, and Steve Lacy. I love to go to concerts when I can because I feel like listening to a 
        musician live changes your perspective on them as an artist. You can feel the emotion that comes 
        through the lyrics and even if there aren't any lyrics the beats and rhythm can give the song meaning. I 
        wanted to create this website so I can share with other music lovers my favorites as well as hear from 
        them to learn more! </p>
    <p>
        Here you will find links from Spotify to all my favorite playlists I have created with all my favorite artists. 
        On the artists page, is a list of my top 10 artists and a little bit about them along with their successes and
        most famous/popular songs. Lastly before you leave the website make sure you go to the suggestions 
        page because there you will be able to find a form that will be sent directly to me so I can branch out 
        and listen to new music. Thank you!</p>
