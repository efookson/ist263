        <h1> Elizabeth Fookson's Biography</h1>
            <p>I am currently a second-year student studying Applied Data Analytics with a minor in Information Management Technology and a concentration in Web Design Management at <strong>Syracuse University</strong>. <br>What interests me the most about this major is how every company/business needs an analyst if they collect data no matter what it is for. I also have an interest in Project Management, especially the satisfaction of seeing a project from start to finish. <br>Some accomplishments I have completed after my first year at Syracuse University are receiving Deans list for the Fall 2022 and Spring 2023 semesters. I am also a peer advisor for the School of Information studies leading new students through IST101 and introducing them to the ISchool. Another accomplishment I am proud of is going on the New York City Immersion trip. I was able to visit companies in NYC and made connections with SU alumni as well as fellow students. </p>
        <h2> Personal Information</h2>
            <p>Outside of school I enjoy going on hikes, traveling, and hanging out with friends and family. Some of my favorite television shows include Parks and Recreation and New Girl. A couple fun facts about me are that I am a twin, I am an Australian citizen, and have visited over 10 countries!</p>
